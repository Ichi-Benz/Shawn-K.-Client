                            After several years of decluttering peoples' homes and figuring out how I can incorporate all I am passionate about (outside of clearing clutter) into my business, I have come up with a very unique service that really resonates with who I am so that I can express all of my creative gifts and help women in the best way possible.

                            Your outer appearance will become more beautiful and radiant as you start to feel more of your inner beauty which may grow as you remove your non-physical and physical clutter

                            You may lose some weight because as you become more conscious of what you have in your home you may also become more conscious of what you put into your body.  <br />You may do less emotional eating as you start to feel better each day
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            You will become empowered knowing that you did not need a decluttering consultant to physically come into your home in order for you to be able to get rid of your clutter (and perhaps just needed some help moving heavy items from a family member or friend) and that you did it with support at a distance, and this will give you the confidence in the future that you can do it!
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            <br />
                            You will live the life that feels best to you unapologetically, no matter what others may think of you or what they say
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            You will love having people come to visit as you get your clutter out
                            <br />
