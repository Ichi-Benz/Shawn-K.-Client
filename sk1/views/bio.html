                    <h1 style="text-align: center;font-family: 'Rochester', cursive">My Story of Passion</h1>
                    Ever since I was very little I have easily been able to express all I felt from my creative side, without a second thought. I had a great childhood. I was a very busy little girl enjoying lots of after school activities, and by age 13 I was already teaching piano and one year later I opened the first beading store/birthday party business for children that became a huge success! In between all of that I somehow found time to help my friends organize things in their bedrooms because I loved doing this, and got homework done. I was also facinated by the unseen world and how we create.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My business endeavors came to an end however when I moved away to university. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology and then two years later with a Master of Science degree in Speech-Language Pathology from Boston University. I discovered a new passion of working with children with physical disabilities and syndromes, helping them communicate to the best of their ability and I have practiced for over 23 years. Although I loved what I was doing and found it so rewarding, at the same time I was somehow frustrated as I felt that my creative and more feminine spirit that liked to create jewellery was neglected.  I could feel some sort of stirring inside of me to do something about my frustrations, however I just got so wrapped up with my work that I ended up shoving all I felt down into myself, perhaps hoping the feelings would go away.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <h1 style="text-align: center;font-family: 'Rochester', cursive">What Became of Me</h1>
                    I soon fell in love, married and had two beautiful baby girls and life all of a sudden got very busy as I was still working for a world renowned children's rehab hospital and in my own private practice. I now had a home full of people I loved to take care of, had to find the time to take care of me, our home, and all of my clients in between running back and forth from daycare and preschools. There really wasn't time left for anything else and I noticed that I was always leaving my needs to last and often didn't even get to them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I remember stripping from my clothes as soon I got home from work because I didn't like wearing more "conservative" kinds of clothing, casual things that you imagine playing in with young children. I wished to be wearing my feminine flowing dresses in the day because I felt prettier in them however often working on the floor or at tiny chairs and desks, getting really dirty sometimes it didn't seem appropriate to in my profession.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Well eventually, I burnt out, totally exhausted myself from overworking, felt lost, suffered from extreme rash on my legs and face (and remember going to sleep with ice packs down my legs every night in January, the coldest time of the year), had a closet full of clothes I did not like, so frustrated that I was wasn't doing all I knew I loved to do, worried to not have a stable income if I tried something else, and was not happy in my marriage. And I tried all I could to make my marriage work and then made the decision to leave when I felt my inner voice expressing that it was the best thing to do, even though also the hardest thing I've ever done.
                    <h1 style="text-align: center;font-family: 'Rochester', cursive">A New Beginning</h1>
                    Now on my own with my girls I moved into a beautiful home and then ended up renting the basement apartment in my parents' home and although I was thankful to have this space and love my parents, at the same time it felt so depressing remembering that before marriage this is where I was living, but upstairs.  My basement bedroom was now about 7' by 10' with a tiny widow close to the ceiling, having room for the single bed that was already there and an old armoire. There was also a teeny tiny closet so I had to quickly learn to declutter my wardrobe and live with less. I felt like a failure in a way being back at home, and so proud of myself in another way.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then one day I thought to myself that if I created these circumstances in my life that didn't feel good, then perhaps I could create something that did feel good, if I chose to do something different. This is when my journey started. For years I felt that I was avoiding the callings of my inner voice and what was in my heart, listening instead to what was in my head and often to others in my life to please them, instead of listening to me.  So I decided that at this time I would start to do something different and listen in to really start to respect me...finally!  I decided to give myself more loving each and every day and it hit me at that moment that my name is French and translates to "Beloved". This was a very clear message to me that I needed to "Be Loved". I needed to love all of who I was unconditionally, listen to my inner voice and take the best care of me.
                    <h1 style="text-align: center;font-family: 'Rochester', cursive">My Divine Journey</h1>
                    I sat down one day and started asking myself what I really wanted in the next year or two, because I was out of my marriage, didn't own a home and had the freedom to really choose what I wanted for myself and my children.  I then made out a wish list. I thought to myself that I would go "all out" and put down all I wanted to have no matter how out of reach it seemed or how extreme, because I realized that the worst thing that could happen would be that some things wouldn't come true! I also have to admit that writing my wishes on paper was very hard to do, because I think some part of me didn't feel like I deserved or could have all I wanted. I eventually told that voice to stay quiet and went ahead with my writing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When I completed my list I put it away and decided that one day everything would come true, or something even better, and gave thanks for this in advance.  I felt excited and happier which gave me energy to start making my living space in the basement more comfortable for me removing objects that didn't make me feel good. And I started to decorate in ways that were symbolic of some of the things I wished for. I found this to be so much fun to do! I started to feel even better as I did this, and had more energy to start taking better care of myself, doing things like exercising more regularly, meditating, journaling and surrounding myself with people who supported me.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On top of making these great changes in my daily life, there was one more significant development, and that was that I started to nurture my femininity. Even though I felt that I was still very much in my "masculine" kind of "take charge" energy as I worked, I would come home and make it a point to shift into my feminine, doing some very fun things to make this happen (and this is what I teach in my consults!).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        <img style="padding: 5px; padding-right:20px;" src="../images/42.png" height="349" width="256" align="left">
                    What I found was that when I got into my feminine energy, I felt different...more beautiful (no matter what I actually looked like after my day or what shape my body was in), graceful, present, relaxed, slower paced, powerful and connected to my true self. And as I felt this each day, I just wanted to do more and more to feed my feminine spirit, so I did.  I started beading again, something I hadn't done in years. I felt that no matter how exhausted I was at the end of the day, when I would create something my energy came back!  That is what happens when you feed your spirit!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also remember deciding that as a reminder to treat myself with the deepest respect and love, I would imagine wearing a beautiful crown on my head.  I wanted to feel like the Queen in my home and in my life. I realized that for years I was not completely respecting myself because I ignored many of my needs (which so often happens after having children I believe), usually putting everyone else's needs in front of my own. Something I then added to my wish list was hoping that someone "like" an American Beauty Pageant Queen, (someone who celebrates their inner and outer beauty and creativity) came into my life because they like the business I am doing (even though I didn't know at the time what my business would be).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I decided that it was time to regularly "practice" all I found out that I loved doing now, excited to see what would happen when I blended all of my passions and new daily practices together.<br /><br /><br />
                    <img style="padding: 5px; padding-top:20px;" src="../images/52-2.png" height="349" width="256" align="right">
                    <h1 style="text-align: center;font-family: 'Rochester', cursive">The Wish List</h1>
                    After living for some time doing all I described above, can you believe that just about ALL of my wishes came true within a year, and the last couple within two years? I could hardly believe it myself! I am SO deeply thankful and appreciative of everything!!! It truly is amazing how my dreams became my reality and with ease, while staying present in my everyday life. My wishes came true in areas of relationship, career, health, residence and much more. If you work with me I share some of my amazing stories and you may find some of them in my newsletters.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When I realized that it truly was incredible that so many huge shifts magically happened for me and in such a short amount of time, I decided that it was time to start sharing all I was doing, to help others create the life of their dreams and this is how my new business formed!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also couldn't believe that by feeling myself as the "Queen" of my home, that the reigning Ms. United States Beauty Pageant Queen came into my life! She ended up offering to be my first "test" virtual decluttering client! And later on she invited me to be a guest on her internet TV show where I shared some basic decluttering ideas to get any man or woman started.  I am quite shy so being taped was a big step for me to take!

                    I practice what I teach and I have a wonderful much less cluttered life inside and out because of this... a life filled with love, peace and beauty. And there is always so much I am learning and there is always something that can be decluttered and now I look so forward to those times!  I love to read and hadn't picked up a book for pleasure since before my girls were born because I felt I never had time to.  Once I started living my new way I found I finally had time for books so I started to read on the topics of psychology, quantum physics and spirituality. I even studied and experienced some Twelve Step Programs as I thought this may be beneficial for my clients. I am now ready to help you create the most exquisite, clutter-free and oh so feminine life!

                    I realized that the most important things we take with us at the end of our lives are our memories and experience of love and love always starts within. I decided to start packing early, taking the useless things out of my suitcase and filling it up with what matters.

                    This may be the time for you to start getting rid of the clutter in your suitcase too, and I am here to help you. And do you know what? You may just happen to find your passion sitting at the bottom of your luggage that is ACHING to be taken out and expressed!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This may be the time to fill yourself up with love and all you love to do, because you deserve the best life and you deserve to express and be all of who you are.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Filling yourself up with love starts with loving all the parts of you. This may be the time to honor your most feminine beautiful self and celebrating this part of you each and every day if you are not doing that already.  This may be what you need in order to clear the clutter from your life.  This may be what you need in order to live your passions and make your dreams come true.
