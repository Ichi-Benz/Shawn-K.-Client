                        "Aimee's Divine Decluttering has had a tremendous influence on my life. When I first came to

                        Aimee, I was already into self development but I hadn't yet prepared my environment to align

                        my inner and outer world. Aimee really helped me to connect from my heart rather than my

                        mind. She had great suggestions to align my physical environment with what I wanted to attract

                        into my life. She helped me to organize my space so that I really loved everything in my home

                        and in the area of love, acting as if my soulmate was already living there with me. I got rid of a

                        lot of old things that I didn't love and replaced them with things that felt really good. The

                        biggest lesson that I learned and continue to apply is the power of our feelings, the power of

                        coming from a heart connection, rather than taking a lot of action from the mind from a place of

                        fear. Once I let go and relaxed into this inspired heart place, my confidence increased and I

                        really could tap into my feminine much quicker and thus attracted amazing things into my life

                        much easier and way more powerful!! By doing all the things that felt good to me, good things

                        would just keep happening. I started the process in January and by the end of May I attracted an

                        unbelievable man into my life. I met him on vacation and after speaking there a few times, we

                        discovered we had met each other 17 years ago at a music camp when we were 16!! This man

                        remembered me so well and even had a picture of the 2 of us from that time, I later found a letter

                        from him in a journal I carried that summer which was so beautiful to read all these years later.

                        We have an incredible soul connection and it's truly amazing what we feel for each other. True

                        love at first sight and soulmates. I don't know what the future holds but I know that radiating

                        love and femininity brought us back together after so many years and I fully trust and have faith

                        in what the Universe has in store for me from this point forward. It is a truly amazing story

                        which I am grateful for every day. Aimee's strategies and ideas really help clarify what's

                        important and coming from a place of letting go rather than controlling, staying in the present

                        moment and asking yourself meaningful questions to direct you through life. She really gives a

                        lot of value for her time and I found the whole experience very unique and genuine. I am so

                        grateful for benefiting from all her expertise and continue to apply what I learned on a daily

                        basis. Aimee's serene and positive energy really makes you feel that she truly cares and wants to

                        give and help as much as possible. I highly recommend Divine Decluttering for anyone that

                        wants to attract their desires into their life while enjoying the process!"

                        &ldquo;Working with Aimee has been a delight for me because she makes decluttering fun, feminine, easy, and exciting!  I call Aimee my &ldquo;Decluttering Life Coach&rdquo;, because she not only helps me clean my space, but it translates into my everyday life.  I used to feel extremely overwhelmed by my space, and it would make me feel depressed and stuck.  After working with Aimee, my space has improved immensely!  It's a lot lighter, fresher, more organized, and it has my own style which really reflects who I feel I am.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There were a lot of things in my life that needed improvement, such as my work, self confidence, and love life.   With her loving, caring, femininely empowering and intelligent ways, Aimee has helped me no only transform my space, but my love life and work happiness too.  She has provided insight to why and how my clutter affects my life, along with easy to follow, refreshing ways to tackle it and in a way that connects me to my most feminine nature which is very unique for a decluttering coach to do!  Now I am enjoying the changes that it has brought me.  I am a lot more confident, calm, relaxed, feel even more beautiful inside and organized because of her.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Aimee is truly a joy to work with, and doesn't make me feel overwhelmed to handle decluttering tasks.  I always feel comfortable to share and show her my &ldquo;messy space&rdquo;, never making me feel bad for it.  Every Skype session with Aimee leaves me feeling inspired and armed to accomplish my goals.   She also holds me to the task, making sure that I get things done.  I have learned and accomplished so much through our sessions, she is such a great support! Thank you so much Aimee for providing the discipline, insight, how to, and inspiration that I need, to be my very best for myself, my man, and for everyone in my life!  You're the best! XO&rdquo;

                        With her jovial and warm nature, Aimee helped to alleviate the stress and not to mention DREAD that comes along with clearing and organizing a cluttered space. I felt much more clear-headed and ready to take on the day and all I desire for my life after my clutter was cleared. In addition to being able to SEE my things and enjoy the beautiful space I live in!

                        expert! As a Feng Shui Consultant, I know firsthand how important living in a clutter-

                        Aimee has a compassionate, yet transformational way of working with her clients to get

                        long lasting results. She not only helps her clients get organized, she also addresses

                        the "root source" of why a person accumulates clutter to prevent it coming back!"

                        &ldquo;Aimee has helped me tremendously with both physical AND emotional decluttering during Skype sessions.  Until doing this with her, I didn't realize what a tremendous difference it could make to thoughtfully clear things in both areas.  As a result, I feel emotionally &ldquo;lighter&rdquo;, less stressed, unencumbered and clearer in my personal and professional focus. Aimee's an unusually insightful, supportive jewel of a person AND a genuine pleasure to work with . If you haven't done something like this before, you should DEFINITELY contact Aimee and have her work with you on it.

                        and functional home gallery for displaying my artwork and receiving clients. I'm so grateful for

                        her help and support, wonderful creative genius in reorganizing my home, and for

                        rearranging the furniture for the best use of space, for flow and display along with comfort for

                        my clients and for daily living. Soon after my living space came to life with the wonderful

                        energy of my creative spirit that was now displayed throughout, I had my first holiday show and

                        sale featuring my paintings, greeting cards and prints and had Aimee as my special guest with

                        her pretty jewellery. I am so proud to show off my paintings now to friends, family and

                        clients in such a perfect setting that I enjoy coming home to every day now! I have also been

                        able to add my health and wellness products to my home gallery space and receive clients for

                        this new business as well. 

                        Thank you, Aimee!!!"

                        &ldquo;I'd always known I had a lot of potential to accomplish great things. The problem was that I had always felt very cluttered mentally. That was reflected in a very disorganized house from my closets, to my drawers, kitchen, and even home office. I had made repeated attempts to clean up but just couldn't make significant changes. Contacting Aimee was a very significant event for me. She came over to my house and over the course of five sessions and about eighteen hours we cleaned up and organized my whole house together. She helped and coached me through the entire process. Strangely for me, cleaning up felt a bit stressful, but ultimately cathartic. Most importantly, I've been able to maintain the organization at home and also continue this pattern of behaviour into other aspects of my life. I can't stress enough how important having an organized home is to so many aspects of my life and I feel that I'm more accomplished now than at any other point. Aimee helped me get the start that I needed.  Thanks Aimee!

It looks and feels fabulous! Thanks so much for sharing your wonderful ideas with me.  It was just want I needed to get started! I have been struggling with my clutter for YEARS and finally you are the one who inspired me to start me off on my decluttering journey! I put two lovely him and hers hangers (grey and pink ones) on the wall rack and hung some cheerful paintings across the way. I have a plant on the floor and my Indonesian storage chest which serves as a seat and a place to put some of my things to get them out of the way. I don't have a front closet so item 2 is done as well. The third is the kitchen and that's a huge job but I'm looking forward to following your recommendations which I wrote down and start the process.  Have a super day and know that you are soooooooooo appreciated!

                        &ldquo;Aimee's one visit to my house struck a chord and compelled me to ask myself the right question: &ldquo;What am I doing with all of this stuff?&rdquo;.  She opened my eyes and made me aware that all this &ldquo;STUFF&rdquo; was weighing me down and literally sucking the energy out of my life.  She catalyzed me to begin the process of removing my personal clutter which transcended to my business clutter.  Now I feel so light that I feel I could fly!  Thanks Aimee!
